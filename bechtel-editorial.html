              <h1>Thoughts on the Bechtel Plan</h1>
              <p>Nicholas Schiefer, Class of 2016</p>

             <hr />

              <p style="clear: both">During my senior year, I had the honour and privilege of serving as the president of Dabney House. In that capacity, my two largest projects were the early planning of the Bechtel Residence and redesigning the system used to assign prefrosh to houses (“the picks system”). As you can imagine, I was keen to read the plan detailing the population of the Bechtel Residence. I found that both students and alumni had mostly strong negative reactions to the plan. I hope that I can clarify some misunderstandings about the present state of affairs and help to guide the ongoing discussions in a productive way.</p>

              <p>In my view, the two most important features of our existing residential system are the integrated, multi-year living environment and the ability to have distinctive, vibrant, and personable residential experiences. While other aspects contribute to the system we have now, I think that these lie at the core.</p>

              <p>A multi-year living environment and the cross-class interactions that it promotes are critical for transmitting key cultural values, like the Honor Code, which are nearly universally held at Caltech but unusual elsewhere. Multi-year living also provides effective mentorship on academic, personal, and career-related matters, and provides support to help new students manage the transition from high school to adult life. Until recently, there seemed to be a significant chance that the Bechtel Residence would house most, if not all, of the incoming freshmen class. In my view, this “all frosh housing” would be among the worst possible departures from our current system, and I am extremely grateful that the current plan took our concerns into account.</p>

              <p>The distinctive and vibrant house personalities are the second piece that makes the house system work. Having reviewed the report in detail, I think that two of the specific proposals will have negative long-term effects on the distinctive house cultures.</p>

              <p>First, I am puzzled by the decision to eliminate the role of house preferences in the picks system. The picks system was completely overhauled during the 2015-2016 academic year and first used in September 2016. Unlike the previous system, which was ad-hoc, complicated, and involved shady practices like “deals” and “trades”, the current system is simple, clean, and based directly on recommendations from the academic literature. Excitingly, the new system is essentially “incentive compatible,” and so can be completely transparent. To be clear, the following exposition is included with the express permission of the IHC.</p>

              <p>The current system uses a technique called prefrosh-optimal stable matching. It proceeds by a series of rounds, where in each round prefrosh “apply” to the house they favor most but have not yet applied to. A house considers everyone who applied to it in that round, or any previous round. If a house has more prefrosh in its “pool” than it has beds, it fills all of its spots with the prefrosh it likes most, provisionally “accepts” them, and returns the rest to the main pool. The process continues until every prefrosh has been placed in a house.</p>

              <p>This process respects prefrosh preferences until it is impossible to do so and uses house preferences only as tiebreakers when there are not enough beds to accommodate prefrosh preferences. Clearly, some procedure must be used to break ties, and this is a fair and reasonable way to do it. Furthermore, the celebrated Gale-Shapley stable matching theorem and its multi-match variants [1, 2] proves that this system has some nice theoretical properties, such as stability: at the end, there are no pairings of prefrosh and houses that, if swapped, would make all parties happier. The process is called “prefrosh-optimal” because it picks, among all such stable matchings, the one that best reflects prefrosh preferences. A system very much like this is currently used by the National Resident Matching Program, which assigns resident physicians to hospitals throughout the United States [3].</p>

              <p>There are some modifications to this system that accomodate complexities of rotation in particular. For example, the IHC has had a longstanding policy of not assigning prefrosh to any of their bottom three picks, and this has recently been extended to four. The North Houses and Avery must also pick an even number of men and women, since all of their freshman rooms are doubles and it is institute policy to never force a man and woman to share a room. As a result, there may be some prefrosh who are not matched to any house at the end of the process, and this is handled by changing a small number (in 2016 it was fewer than 10) of assignments in “unstable matching”.</p>

              <p>As you can see, the current picks system aims for simplicity and fairness. There are no “deals” or “trades” or anything else resembling the system used until 2015.</p>

              <p>The Bechtel Plan is somewhat vague, but it suggests something along the lines of this system, but with ties broken randomly. If you accept that house preferences are better than random, then moving to this new system will likely worsen the quality of the average match. Often, one house or another is unusually popular, and a random system cannot use any meaningful information to resolve contention for bed spaces.</p>

              <p>As a prefrosh, an upperclassman, and later a house president, I found the rotation process tiring and unlikeable. However, I think that house preferences have a good&mdash;albeit not perfect&mdash;correlation with the actual quality of fit. While it might make the initial week or two worse for everyone, I think that the additional input from the houses substantially increases the quality of the average assignment. Statistically, most people stay with their house for many years, and it seems short sighted to worsen the average fit in order to save some time and energy in the first week. I think that some of the downsides can be addressed without eliminating the core system: I welcome involvement of the RAs and especially a new understanding of the way that the picks system actually works.</p>

              <p>One might question the importance of match quality in the residential experience. For me, finding Dabney was a defining part of my Caltech experience. I grew up as in a social environment that did not fit me well, and it stunted my personal and intellectual growth. Rotating into Dabney was like “coming home,” and I would not be who I am today without that experience. I understand that this experience is quite common, and I think that giving more people a better chance at a good match is critical.</p>

              <p>The Bechtel Plan argues that that judging and ranking prefrosh goes against core Caltech values. I disagree; I think that such judgments are difficult and unpleasant, but ultimately worthwhile. Certainly, we find “judging and ranking” prefrosh acceptable in many academic contexts where we seek a high quality of fit. Among other things, the diagnostic exams provided to prefrosh are excellent tools to match them to classes that will suit them well. I agree that being judged is an unpleasant experience, but again, I think that the short term unpleasantness is worthwhile if it provides even somewhat better matches. Furthermore, it is powerful for both the prefrosh and houses to pursue community in an intentional way. Echoing the sentiment of fellow alumnus Adam Jermyn (Dabney, Class of 2015), having both groups ask and carefully consider the question “Who do I want to live with, and who will like living with me?” is intrinsically valuable to the community.</p>

              <p>In light of this, I think that a good compromise is to eliminate or substantially curtail the “unstable matching” phase, which exists primarily to preserve the current sizes of the houses.</p>

              <p>I suspect that I disagree with many other students and alumni on this aspect of the Bechtel Plan, since I think that growing and shrinking houses in response to demand is a good idea, provided that the houses remain contiguous living areas so that they have “ownership” over some physical space. Subject to this, I think that the core idea is excellent. As the report suggests, it provides a strong incentive for houses to evolve along with the changing student body.</p>

              <p>More fundamentally, I think that distinctive and intentional communities often have “natural sizes” based on the specifics of their personality; this is intrinsic, inevitable, and certainly not a bad thing! Speaking from my own experience in Dabney, which many find has a quirky and unusual culture: I do not think that Dabney will ever successfully serve the entire student body, or even a large fraction of it. However, it can be (and is!) an outstanding community for its ~120 members. Already, the reduced number of freshmen allocated to each house will allow for greater intentionality in our communities. I support redistributing bed space&mdash;subject to physical and logistical constraints&mdash;in order to help houses achieve their “natural size.”</p>

              <p>My second concern is the mechanism for implementing any redistribution. While the report does not describe it, I suspect that it (like eco-rotation [4]) will be based on the popularity of houses among prefrosh, since that data is easy to gather and aligns with the idea of respecting prefrosh choice to the maximum extent. However, some houses (such as Dabney, during my time at Caltech) are less popular during rotation, but retain a large number of active members and even see a significant number of people joining later on. This tended to hurt us during rotation and caused a persistent housing shortage. Based on our extensive discussions and my own experience, I believe that Dabney’s unusual culture can be a bit off-putting to prefrosh, especially those coming into an unfamiliar environment from a relatively sheltered background. Despite its trouble during rotation, Dabney clearly has substantial appeal, since we have a high active membership and see so many people join once they became more comfortable in a college environment.</p>

              <p>As a result, I urge the administration to implement redistribution by looking at the demand for beds in a house across all years, and shrink the number of prefrosh “assigned” to that house as needed. I agree that there is some delicate policy work to be done here, but I believe that it can be done. Implemented poorly, redistribution could shrink effective, popular, vibrant, but quirky houses.</p>

              <p>Of course, this raises the question of whether distinctive personalities are necessary for positive residential experiences. At first glance, you might expect that these personalities could be replaced by other mechanisms for encouraging community, like providing funding and administrative support for group activities. In both my personal experience and the academic literature, this doesn’t really work. My graduate residence had plenty of money to put on events, and even some professional staff, but the events themselves were boring, under-attended, and did little to promote community; I suspect that most people attended for the free food.</p>

              <p>This stands in stark contrast to my experience in Dabney. Part of the difference is probably that my fellow Darbs chose to live there because they found like minded people. Furthermore, a vibrant culture tends to breed more culture by encouraging personality development. However, I think that a more key difference is that there was a spirit of togetherness that coalesced around a collective ownership of our identity. In blunt terms, we were a coherent community because we had a distinctive culture that was fundamentally <em>ours</em>.</p>

              <p>This effect has been well noted by humanists and social scientists. At its core, preserving the distinctiveness of the houses is important because personality and identity are critical to what is sometimes called a “thick community.” Fellow alumnus Sam Elder (Avery, Class of 2012) introduced me to the concept in an insightful blog post [5]. Sam quotes David Brooks writing in The New York Times:</p>

              <blockquote>Some organizations are thick, and some are thin. Some leave a mark on you, and some you pass through with scarcely a memory. […] A thick institution is not one that people use instrumentally, to get a degree or to earn a salary. A thick institution becomes part of a person’s identity and engages the whole person: head, hands, heart and soul.</blockquote>

              <p>Sam goes on to talk about how thick communities should be cherished, and how the distinctiveness of the houses is a huge part of what makes them thick rather than thin. I would characterize my high school community, and the community that springs up around classwork, to be fundamentally thin. In contrast, the houses are generally extremely thick communities. Last year I spent nearly two weeks of my vacation time at Caltech, doing challenging, exhausting work assisting seniors with Ditch Day; I do this because my house community still matters to me. I was lucky to experience a number of thick communities at Caltech, including my house, my research lab, and the community surrounding the Ph11 freshmen seminar. I suspect that I was unusually fortunate, and that most Caltech students experience thick community primarily through their houses. Intense, loveable, thick communities were the core of my Caltech experience; without them, Caltech would have lost its distinctiveness entirely and collapsed into a university just like many others, but with slightly harder classes.</p>

              <p>While I am less encouraged by other parts of the plan, I worry that students and alumni might be reading too far into some of the vaguer statements in the plan. For example, the plan calls for changes to upperclass picks to avoid making the Bechtel Residence “a substitute for unaffiliated off-campus housing” in the current year. Furthermore, it calls for flexibility from all as we move into the new residence. While I have doubts about the specifics of the described plan, I expect that it will largely be executed in a reasonable manner, and that the number of students displaced from their preferred houses will not be larger than in past years; in fact, I expect that more people will get to live in their preferred house, since more prefrosh will be allocated to Bechtel. Given that nearly all houses have more demand for their rooms than they can accommodate, allocating people to houses that they do not want to live in, or who would not be welcome in the house, would require shocking and near-negligent administrative action.</p>

              <p>In any case, I suspect that the impact of this will be short-lived, so long as each house remains mostly occupied by its existing members. In contrast, I think that the two changes I outlined here could fundamentally shape the next few decades of residential life at Caltech. I urge students and alumni to focus on core issues with lasting impact&mdash;whether these or others, if you disagree&mdash;and to pursue this discussion with a thoughtful emphasis on policy.</p>

              <p>Communities like the houses should be treasured, and I think that, with some changes, the Bechtel plan can help to build and maintain thick communities for the next generation of Caltech students.</p>
